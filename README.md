# API-JSON-parsing-Python

An experiment designed to deal with API feeds. We then move on to unravel or flatten nested or heirarchical key value pairs or JSON type data objects in Python.

JSON parsing can be done in Power BI, but it it extremely extremely slow. It is much easier if we let Power BI have tabular data to deal with. So we will try to flatten the JSON in Python and convert to a tabular dataset.

Dedicated to the long hours I spent flattening the Acquinex API
